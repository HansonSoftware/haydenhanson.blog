## The Last Great ThinkPad.

Many say that the T480 is the last great ThinkPad model. Its number of useful ports, compatability with linux, the TrackPoint and potential to upgrade are all reasons why I agree.

## Software

OS: Arch Linux
WC (Wayland Compositor): Hyprland

## Hardware

I am using the ThinkPad T480 14.0" FHD Touchscreen with an i5-8350U CPU, 16GB DDR4 RAM and a fingerprint reader.

I upgraded the external battery to a 72WH battery.

This post is a work in progress..
