## Bullet Points:

- This was a project for CS 367, GMU's Systems Programming course.
- I was tasked to build process scheduling functionality for a pre-built VM, KAIA.
- My program was built with C and had no memory leaks, tested with Valgrind.
- For more information about this project or the source code, please don't hesitate to contact me. I must abide by GMU's honor code policy!

## The Goal:

The main goal with this project was to build a custom process scheduler that achieves all the specifications requested. Another goal was to build a robust, well-documented C program with efficient memory management.

## What I've learned:

Implementing data structures such as a Linked List, Dynamic Array, and HashMap in C. How to interact with the operating system. Efficient, "low-level" memory management.
